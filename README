BME680 float algorithm implementated in Python

The BME680 is an environmental sensor manufactured by Bosch

It is alble to calculate pressure, humidity, temperature, and air quality.
This project implements the float algorithm to convert ADC values recorded by the sensor and calculate these readings in usable units.
All math is done natively in Python with the math module.
There are additional support functions that dovetail with things done with these kind of sensors.
